NOTES
=====

  The point of this directory is to contain and version controll my
  dot files. At current most dotfiles or configuration on a per user
  level is kept at the home directory. Unfornately this makes it very
  hard to version controll and keep in sync between machines. This is
  my attempt to slove this. I'm going to be using branches for indivual 
  machines that need to be different. the _master_ branch will contain
  the most common configurations, each system that is differnt will 
  contain a branch with a descriptive name. 

NAME SCHEME
===========
  
  The branch naming scheme is as follows:

Exceptions
----------

  * master -- This is special and contains the most common configuration

General Format
--------------

  > nameSpace_ComputerID

  * nameSpace -- is a descriptive name for an area that computer lives in, this could be _work_, _home_, or even _company name_. It should be camel-cased,
  * ComputerID -- is a descriptive name for the computer, this can be the host name or a identifier that allows one to figure which computer it belongs to.
